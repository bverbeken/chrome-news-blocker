# chrome-news-blocker

Simple chrome extension to block news sites. 

I quite enjoyed reading Rolf Dobelli's Stop Reading the News (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48581422-stop-reading-the-news). 

The problem with the book is: it tells you *why* you should go on a news diet, but not *how*. Hence this simple chrome extension.
